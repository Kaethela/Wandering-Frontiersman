# Wandering-Frontiersman
## MODLIST SUMMARY
A list combining Tale of Two Wastelands with Fallout: The Frontier, allowing one to play through Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Fallout: The Frontier in one continuous save file. This list includes updated textures, gameplay improvements, and quality of life fixes.

## REQUIREMENTS
* Current version of [Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)
* Clean, legally acquired installs of both Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. **Both games must be installed on the same disk.**
* A legally acquired copy of [Tale of Two Wastelands](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl)
* A Nexusmods account. Nexus premium is **HIGHLY** recommended for automatic downloads.
* 70GB Of free space. This figure does not include Fallout 3 or New Vegas installations.
Once Fallout 3 and New Vegas are installed, run them both once through Steam. This will set up registry keys and allow Wabbajack to recognize them. Fallout 3 may not run - this is expected and normal.

## MODLIST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder anywhere that is **NOT** Program Files or your Desktop.
3. Place the downloaded Wabbajack.exe into this folder.
4. Run Wabbajack.exe. Locate Wandering Frontiersman on the gallery and click the down arrow to download the modlist file.
5. In **Installation Location** select an empty folder that is **NOT** located in Program Files or your Desktop. **DO NOT INSTALL THIS LIST INTO YOUR STEAM GAME PATH OR THE FOLDER WITH THE WABBAJACK EXE.**
6. Download location will auto-populate. This can be changed if you prefer.
7. Click the button with the Play Arrow to begin the process.
8. Accept the Nexusmods API request if asked.
9. When Wabbajack completes you will see either a green **Installation Complete** screen or a red **Installation Failed** screen. If successful, proceed to the Tale of Two Wastelands install instructions.

## TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. If you haven't already, download the TTW 3.2 Installer, the 3.2.1 Incremental Update, and the 3.2.2 Incremental Update.
2. Extract all three zip files to an empty folder. It is recommended that this folder be on your Desktop for ease of access.
3. Run the TTW Install.exe file located in the folder you just extracted these files to.
4. Select **TTW_v3.2_Full** and click the install button.
5. The installer will automatically detect your Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas installation paths. Confirm that these are correct.
6. Change the Tale of Two Wastelands install path to a new, empty folder. This folder is again recommended to be on your Desktop for ease of access.
7. Click **Install** and wait patiently until the program is completed.
8. Repeat steps 3 through 7, this time selecting **TTW_v3.2_to_v3.2.1_Update.** Install the update to the same folder you installed the base 3.2 installation to.
9. Repeat once more, this time selecting **TTW_v3.2.1_to_v3.2.2_Update.** As before, install this update to the same folder you installed the base install and the update to.
10. Cut and Paste this folder into your Wandering Frontiersman mods folder.
11. Open Mod Organizer 2, located in your Wandering Frontiersman install folder. 
12. Press F5 to refresh the program, then enable the TTW mod install on the lefthand panel.
13. Download [loadorder.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dWpzJmbreDCbo8s6Kx6pa4eKMCeXsAYx/view?usp=sharing) and place it in profiles > Wandering Frontiersman located in your Wandering Frontiersman install folder.
14. Press F5 to refresh Mod Organizer 2. It should now reflect the updated TTW load order.

## BEFORE YOU BEGIN PLAYING
* On the left panel is a mod entitled **lStewieAI's Tweaks** - this is a file loaded with options that change how the game plays. The most important setting in this file is experience rate. By default, the list will set it to 50% of base value. Feel free to change this as you wish.
* Included in this list is a quick start mod that will skip all of the introductory Vault 101 gameplay and start you in the exit tunnel, where you can create your character. If you wish to experience the full Vault 101 beginning, disable the mod **Tale of Two Wastelands Quick Start.**
* This list includes the mod **Immersive Minigames.** It de-levels all locks and terminals such that you are able to bypass the minigame and attempt to unlock or hack anything, regardless of your skill level. You can have this override the vanilla lockpicking and hacking interface or have it as a standalone. To hack or lockpick in this fashion, press your chosen hotkey on the lock or terminal and hold it down for roughly five seconds. The action may be successful, or it may fail. Consequences of failure include breaking the lock, being permanently locked out of the terminal, or making the lock/terminal significantly harder to unlock.
* The Frontier is much more graphically intense than Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Do not expect to hit 60 FPS at all times while playing.
* **TTW IS INTENDED FOR A FALLOUT 3 START. IF YOU START IN NEW VEGAS YOU WILL BREAK THE LIST.**

## MCM SETTINGS
*  **JIP S-F**
    * General Settings - Set fire-mode switch key to whatever you prefer.
    * HUD Indicator Settings - Adjust to your preference. Option 1 displays the widget in the top right corner of the screen, while option 2 displays it close to your ammo count.
* **Enhanced Item Info**
    * Disable Always Show List Box in both GameMode and Menumode.
* **Just Mods**
    * Disable Hold Breath and Loot Menu.
* **Immersive Minigames**
    * Set to E to override vanilla minigames or to a different hotkey to have it act as standalone.
    * Disable Activate After Unlock

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
* **Where's NVTF, CASM, or other required utilities?**
* CASM's functionality has been replicated in lStewieAI's Tweaks. NVTF and other critical tools were included in The Frontier and did not need to be installed separately

* **Where's AWOP, New Vegas Bounties, or other content additions?**
* The focus of this list is to create a stable TTW + The Frontier experience. This resulted in a prettier vanilla experience. Additional content mods may be added in the future if doing so does not destabilize the list.

* **Can I add or remove mods to this list?**
* No. The Frontier has a very strict compatibility list which precludes adding a fair amount of popular mods. This is why BLEED and JSawyer are not included, among others. **IF YOU CHANGE THIS LIST IN ANY WAY YOU VOID ALL SUPPORT.**
